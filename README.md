Andrew here. Day 1 (23 Jun 2020) of trying to figure out my life direction and what I want to do in my professional life. Is it coding? Or building computers? Or networking? Or maybe even cyber security? Can't start if you aren't curious! Curiousity didn't kill the cat, the cat got richer and more fulfilled! :)
